# CS50 AI with Python

A comprehensive collection of Artificial Intelligence fundamental implementations for hands-on learning. This repository contains practical implementations of key AI concepts covered in Harvard's CS50 AI course.

## 📚 Topics Covered

### 1. Search Algorithms
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Explores as far as possible along each branch
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Explores all neighbors before moving to next level
- **Greedy Best-First Search**: Uses heuristics to find solutions efficiently
- **A* Search**: Combines actual cost and heuristic for optimal pathfinding
- **Minimax Algorithm**: Game playing with adversarial search

### 2. Knowledge Representation
- **Propositional Logic**: Representing and reasoning with logical statements
- **First-Order Logic**: Advanced logical reasoning with predicates
- **Inference Engines**: Drawing conclusions from knowledge bases

### 3. Uncertainty
- **Probability Theory**: Handling uncertain information
- **Bayesian Networks**: Representing dependencies between variables
- **Markov Models**: Modeling sequential events

### 4. Optimization
- **Hill Climbing**: Local search optimization
- **Simulated Annealing**: Probabilistic optimization technique
- **Constraint Satisfaction**: Solving problems with constraints

### 5. Machine Learning
- **Supervised Learning**: Learning from labeled data
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Finding patterns in unlabeled data
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Learning through interaction and rewards

### 6. Neural Networks
- **Perceptrons**: Basic neural network building blocks
- **Deep Learning**: Multi-layer neural networks
- **Convolutional Neural Networks**: Image processing and computer vision
