# CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python

> Harvard University's CS50 AI - Hands-on Learning Journey

## About This Course

This repository contains my work and projects for [CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/), offered by Harvard University. The course explores the concepts and algorithms at the foundation of modern artificial intelligence.

## Course Topics

- **Search** - Finding solutions to problems using search algorithms
- **Knowledge** - Representing information and drawing inferences
- **Uncertainty** - Dealing with uncertain events using probability
- **Optimization** - Finding optimal solutions among many possibilities
- **Learning** - Machine learning techniques and neural networks
- **Neural Networks** - Deep learning and computer vision
- **Language** - Natural language processing
